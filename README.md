# CSS422
Deliverable #1 for CSS422

I have implemented HalsteadLength and NumberOfComments checks

identifiers, doubles, integers, floats and longs should count as operands.
all unary, logical, arithmetic, relational, bitwise, ternary and assignment operators should count as operators.

Comments and block comments should increment the NumberOfComments count
